# oblong industries :: mezzanine

As a **Product Manager for Mezzanine** *(2018-2020)*, I owned the user experience of a pioneering immersive meeting environment, which enabled any team to bind remote rooms together and work as though side by side. Mezzanine rooms found a market with an extensive list of Fortune 500 customers and featured innovative forms of interaction unique in its product category.

In addition to making measurable improvements in the usability of the core product, I also championed a new, radically simpler edition of Mezzanine, and led the effort to ship it in 6 months, enabling a tighter integration with the products of a critical partner.

# oblong industries :: client solutions division

As **Director of Engineering for Oblong's Client Solutions division** *(2010-2018)*, I grew and led an interdisciplinary team of engineers and designers in creating a series of highly complex immersive environments for demanding Fortune 100 clients. Our ability to build interactive spatial experiences using realtime graphics in 100-million-pixel physical environments led to attention and awards such as a 2018 UX Design Award for the “IBM Watson Experience Centers”.  

I played the roles of chief technical architect, primary client point of contact, project manager, and team lead.

# oblong industries :: ibm watson experience centers

The Client Solutions team's work was the centerpiece of a series of IBM Watson Experience Centers -- located in New York, San Francisco, Cambridge, and Munich -- whose purpose was educate IBM's customers and constituents about machine learning. Both the reality of machine learning, and its potential, were brought to light through a series of unique, interactive, realtime data visualizations and setpieces, developed from 2013 to 2020. 

The Centers were a technology showcase featured a variety of environments created by Oblong, including large display walls and immersion rooms, which could be controlled by touch, by spatial pointing devices, by voice, and more.

This [UX Design Award-winning collaboration](https://ux-design-awards.com/en/gewinner/ibm-watson-experience-centers) with IBM and design agency [Local Projects](https://www.localprojects.com/) was prototyped and developed at Oblong’s headquarters in Los Angeles as well as IBM’s Immersive AI Lab in Austin.

# oblong industries :: process

Most client work can't be shared here, but these videos give insight into my team's prototyping process and illustrate various technical achievements in realtime data visualization, high performance distributed rendering, interaction design, systems integration, and more.

# oblong industries :: greenhouse sdk 

I was one of the principal architects, authors, and maintainers of Greenhouse, a C++ creating coding SDK based on Oblong's g-speak spatial operating platform. Compared to g-speak, Greenhouse's goal was to offering more approachable abstractions and quicker time-to-joy. It was released to the public at greenhouse.oblong.com; and was heavily used within the Oblong Client Solutions group to execute production-quality work for over 5 years.

# oblong industries: saudi aramco (2010-2011)

Using Oblong's g-speak software platform, we created a geology visualization application which could be controlled by glove interactions in free space, by touchscreen, by mobile phone, and by web interface. This video shows me doing some prototyping work, using a miniature version of the real, much larger system which existed in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

# accenture interactive wall (2004-2006)

"The Wall" was the earliest multi-touch, high-performance pixel wall to see daily use in public -- it was usable by the general public in O’Hare, JFK, and other airports for 10 years after its debut. It was the subject of numerous research papers, some of which are still referenced in HCI literature, and played a pioneering role in the domain of public interactive technology experiences.

I made core contributions to every part of this new platform, from hardware prototyping to patented computer vision algorithms, to physical enclosure design, to designing a 60fps clustered rendering framework (C++/DirectX), to building applications on that framework, and supporting other developers doing the same
