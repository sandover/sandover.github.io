# selected projects and products

&nbsp;

As a **Product Manager for Mezzanine**, I owned the user experience of a pioneering immersive meeting environment, which enabled any team to bind remote rooms together and work as though side by side. Mezzanine rooms found a market with an extensive list of Fortune 500 customers
and featured innovative forms of interaction unique in its product category.

As **Director of Engineering for Oblong's Client Solutions division**, I grew and led an interdisciplinary team of engineers and designers in creating a series of highly complex immersive environments for demanding Fortune 100 clients. Our ability to build interactive spatial experiences using realtime graphics in 100-million-pixel physical environments led to attention and awards such as a 2018 UX Design Award for the “IBM Watson Experience Centers”.  

I played the roles of chief technical architect, primary client point of contact, project manager, and team lead.
